Agenda
• Describing users  
– User models (ref class 2)
– User group (who are the users ?)
– (a few yet useful) methods
• Profiling questionnaires
• Modeling roles
• Personnas
2
What does it mean user group ?
• The first requirement of practical HCI design is to 
identify who the users will be!
• Users groups describe the characteristics of target users 
of an interactive system 
• Process for identifying and selecting users
– define the characteristics of the user population, i.e. user groups
– work with a representative sample of the user group
3
User Groups (or WHO?)
• Characteristics of the User
• Focusing on the User means: ask questions, try to
get answers
• Things we want to ask:
– Questions related to the person (demographic information),
– Attitude (e.g. towards work: motivation, interests, readiness to
asume a risk),
– Frequency the product is used,
– Knowledge in the (working) area,
– Experiences in other areas (education, technical background) 
– (software) products used
– Language used (e.g. technical terms, entertainment, …) 
User Groups (or WHO?)
• Who are the users?
– Primary and secundary users
– Buyers or substitute (or representativeà users)
• Description of the Users:
– Jobs, Tasks, Tools, mental models
– Individuell Differences
– Usage of products
User groups (or WHO?)
• How to learn about the users?
– Who is having contact with the users (e.g. hotline)?
– What kind of users and potential users can we think of?
– User/Task Matrix (who is doing what, and how often)?
– Typical characteristics of the user-community
– EVALUTE your ASSUMPTIONS!!

Describing and assessing user groups  
• Methods for describing user groups
– User roles, personas, user profiling
• Methods for assessing user groups
– Interviews, questionnaires, focus groups … 
• Important Problems
– Every user is an unique individual (variation in the population)
– In some cases, users tasks and responsibilities might be more 
important that individuals preferences but not always…
– Stereotyped views of users is a dangerous and yet necessary tradeoff 
8
User characteristics 
(based on learning skills and usage)
• A simplest classification:
– Users are: NOVICE or EXPERT
– Usage is: FREQUENT or INFREQUENT
• Defining user ability 
– Levels of ability e.g. novice, advanced beginner, competent user, 
proficient user, expert (Dreyfus, 1980)
– Revised frequency of usage (constant, regular, occasional)
– Task familiarity (slanted towards technical ability)
– Degree of usage of similar technology (dissimilar hardware/software).
– Demographic data (user age and status profile)
– Value perception (particularly relevant to the introduction of new 
technology)

Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition. Washington, DC: Storming Media. 
Ascertain User’s Needs
• Define tasks
– Tasks
– Subtasks
• Frequency
– Frequent
– Occasional
– Exceptional
– Repair
• Ex. difference between a space 
satellite, car engine, and fighter jet

Reliability
• Actions function as specified
• Data displayed must be correct
• Updates done correctly
• Leads to trust! (software, 
hardware, information) – case: 
Pentium floating point bug
• Privacy, security, access, data 
destruction, tampering

Standardization, Integration, 
Consistency, Portability
• Standardization – common user-interface features across 
multiple applications
– Apple
– Web
– Windows
• Integration – across application packages
– file formats
• Consistency – common action sequences, terms, units, 
layouts, color, typography within an application
• Portability – convert data and interfaces across multiple 
hardware and software environments
– Word/HTML/PDF/ASCII
Usability Measures
• How can we measure the 
‘goodness’ of an interface?
• What are good metrics?
• ISO 9241
– Effectiveness
– Efficiency
– Satisfaction
• Schneiderman
– Time to learn
– Speed of performance
– Rate of errors
– Retention over time
– Subjective satisfaction

Usability Motivations
• Life-Critical systems
– Applications: air traffic, nuclear reactors, military, emergency dispatch
– Requirements: reliability and effective (even under stress)
– Not as important: cost, long training, satisfaction, retention
• Industrial and Commercial Use
– Applications: banking, insurance, inventory, reservations
– Requirements: short training, ease of use/learning, multiple languages, 
adapt to local cultures, multiplatform, speed
• Office, Home, and Entertainment
– Applications: E-mail, ATMs, games, education, search engines, cell 
phones/PDA
– Requirements: Ease of learning/use/retention, error rates, satisfaction
– Difficulties: cost, size
•Time to learn
•Speed of performance
•Rate of errors
•Retention over time
•Subjective satisfaction
Usability Motivations
• Exploratory, Creative, Collaborative
– Applications: Web browsing, search engines, simulations, 
scientific visualization, CAD, computer graphics, music 
composition/artist, photo arranger (email photos)
– Requirements: remove the ‘computer’ from the 
experience, 
– Difficulties: user tech savvy-ness (apply this to application 
examples)
• Socio-technical systems
– Applications: health care, voting, police
– Requirements: Trust, security, accuracy, veracity, error 
handling, user tech-savy-ness
•Time to learn
•Speed of performance
•Rate of errors
•Retention over time
•Subjective satisfaction
Universal Usability
• Interface should handle diversity of 
users
– Backgrounds
– Abilities
– Motivation
– Personalities
– Cultures
• Question, how would you design an 
interface to a database differently for:
– A. right-handed female, Indian, software 
engineer, technology savvy, wants rapid 
interaction
– B. left-handed male, French, artist

Universal Usability
• Does not mean ‘dumbing down’
– Ex. Helping disabled has helped 
others (parents w/ strollers, 
elderly)
– Ex. Door handles
• Goal: Address the needs of 
more users - unlike yourself!
• Everyone is often not at full 
faculties at all times

Physical Variation
• Ability
– Disabled (elderly, 
handicapped, vision, 
ambidexterity, ability to 
see in stereo 
[SUTHERLAND])
– Speed
– Color deficiency
• Workspace 
– Science of ergonomics
– Size
– Design
• Lots of prior research

Physical Variation
• Field of anthropometry
– Measures of what is 5-95% for 
weight, height, etc. (static and 
dynamic)
– Large variance reminds us there is 
great ‘variety’
– Name some devices that this would 
affect.
• note most keyboards are the same
• screen brightness varies considerably
• chair height, back height, display 
angle
• Multi-modal interfaces
• Audio
• Touch screens

Cognitive and Perceptual Variation
• Bloom’s Taxonomy
– knowledge, comprehension, analysis, application, 
synthesis, evaluation
• Memory
– short-term and working
– long-term and semantic
• Problem solving and reasoning
• Decision making
• Language and communication
Cognitive and Perceptual Variation
• Language and 
communication
• Search, imagery, sensory 
memory
• Learning, skill 
development, knowledge 
acquisition
• Confounding factors:
– Fatigue
– Cognitive load
– Background
– Boredom
– Fear
– Drugs/alcohol

Personality
• Computer anxiety
• Gender
– Which games do women like?
– Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Tetris
– Why? (Hypotheses: less violent, 
quieter soundtracks, fully visible 
playing fields, softer colors, 
personality, closure/completeness)
– Can we measure this?
• What current games are for 
women?
• Style, pace, top-down/bottom-up, 
visual/audio learners, dense vs. 
sparse data

Personality
• No simple taxonomy of user 
personality types.  Ex. Myers-
Briggs Type Indicator
– Extrovert vs. introvert
– Sensing vs. intuition
– Perceptive vs. judging
– Feeling vs. thinking
• Weak link between personality 
types and interfaces
• Think about your application, and 
see if user personality is 
important!
– Fighter jets vs. search engines

Cultural and International Diversity
• Language
• Date / Time conventions
• Weights and Measures
• Left-to-right
• Directions (!)
• Telephone #s and addresses
• Names, titles, salutations
• SSN, ID, passport

Users with Disabilities
• Eye Gaze control
• Learning what helps those with 
disabilities affects everyone
– Present procedures, directions, and 
instructions accessible to even poor 
readers
– Design feedback sequences that 
explain the reason for error and help 
put users on the right track
– Reinforcement techniques with other 
devices
• Good target area for a final 
project!

Elderly
• Reduced
– Motor skills

solving, etc.)
• Touch screens, larger fonts, louder 
sounds

Children

kid with an Ice Age DVD?)
– Don’t like patronizing comments, inappropriate humor
• Design: Focus groups

Accommodating Hardware and 
Software Diversity
• Support a wide range of hardware and software 
platforms
• Software and hardware evolution
– OS, application, browsers, capabilities
– backward compatibility is a good goal
• Three major technical challenges are:
– Producing satisfying and effective Internet interaction 
(broadband vs. dial-up & wireless)
– Enabling web services from large to small (size and 
resolution)
– Support easy maintenance of or automatic conversion to 
multiple languages
User groups modeling techniques
• Inferring individuals facts, patterns of user 
behaviors, condition-action rules
– Task models
– Scenarios
• Using stereotypes to infer many things at a 
time
– User roles
– User profiles
– Persona
32
User characteristics to consider
• Demographic data: 
– Age, gender, education, occupation, cultural background, 
special needs, computer training and knowledge, 
experience with similar systems/products
• Traits and intelligence: 
– cognitive styles, affective traits, skill sets or capability
• Job or task related factors: 
– job characteristic, knowledge of application and job 
familiarity, rate of use of the computer (in work)
33
Design for the target audience

– Age, sex, education, job type, socio-economic status, role in organization.
– Lifestyle, personality, emotions and attitudes (e.g. toward using a technology).
– Skills.
– Physical abilities and constraints, e.g. poor eyesight, color blindness, etc.
• Task related characteristics:
– Goals and motivation.
– Tasks.
– Usage (heavy vs. light, frequency, indirect or remote).
– Training and experience (from novice to expert).
•    Geographic and social characteristics:
– Location: regions, countries, continents, market areas.
– Cultures and other circumstances.
– Social connections and societies.
36
Example
1. # of users that occupy this user type
2. General responsibilities or activities
3. Computer skills
4. Domain expertise
5. Goals: how does the tool help this user reach their goals?
6. Pain Points: what nagging problems can the tool help to 
solve?
7. Usage Contexts: where will the tool be used?
8. Tool Ecosystem: what other tools does this user type rely on?
9. Collaborators: who does this user work with to help reach their 
goals?
10.Frequency of Use: how often is this type of user likely to use the 
tool?
37
To help understanding the characteristics of 
users/customers that might have bearing on 
the design, construct a profile containing 
information about the type of user relevant 
to the tool being created.
Characteristics suitable for this user 
type (design imperatives)
▪ ease of learning
▪ retention of learning
▪ efficiency of interaction
▪ reliability of interaction
▪ user satisfaction
▪ user convenience
▪ necessity for proficiency
▪ importance of accuracy
38
Questionnaire
• How do we formulate the question?
• What kind of question (and what kind of 
answers) are appropriate?
• Why do we ask the question?
Knowledge of the Interviewed
1. Explications: open/closed questions
2. Information level of the interviewed:
1. Unclear terms
2. Abstract terms
→ conduct a pretest
3. Multi-Dimensions of questions
Formulating Questions
4. Ordering questions:
• From the general to the special
• 5 dimensions for questions
• Consciousness: open knowledge question: What do you understand by 
participation in the decision process?“
• Unconcsious attitude: open question: What role should unions play for 
the decision process? 
• Specific attitude: closed question: Some people say that the employers 
should have the mayority in the board of directors, other say employers 
and employees should have the same number of seats – what do you 
think? 
• Reasons: Open-Why question: Why do you think that? 
• Itensity: Closed itensity question: „How sure are you: very sure, sure, 
not sure, not sure at all? 
5. Blurrred questions („Do you also think that there are too 
many foreign people living here?“)
Is the question appropriate? 
• There is an important distinction in open 
and closed questions:
• Open: How do most of your colleagues 
tink about working again 42 hours per 
week? 
• Closed: Are most of your colleagues 
sopporting or declining to work 42 hours 
per week? 
Researcher Background
• Questions are asked with a reason: typically they are 
related to a hypothesis that should be validated. One 
question is normally not enough!
• Do not formulate a hypothesis as a direct question:
– Are you a neurotic character?
– Do you feel isolated in your appartment outside of the 
city?
– Are you able to use the new interface? 
Rules for asking questions
• Short, simply, rely on the background of the interviewed person.
• The longer an event is ago, the less precise will be the answer
• The more a person is interested in the topic, the more valid the answer
• The more important an event for the person, the more detailed the
answer
• The more dangourous the event for the person, the more they will tend to
forget the event
• The more social disapprovement, the less likely it will be reported
• The more important something is (e.g. income), the more the answers
will be exagerated
• Using a closed question with two alternatives: the later alternative will be
more attractive!
Rules for asking questions
Open Questions:
• The order items are named, must not mean the 
order of importance. Sometimes even the most 
important aspect is not named, as it is so self-
evident. 
• The number of items named will increase with the 
time you allow the person to respond, and the more 
you encourage the person to answer. Take care not 
to suggest things!!
Rules for asking questions
Closed questions:
• The more detailed someone was thinking about a position 
and his/her reasons for that position, the less likely s/he will 
get along with a given list of answers
• The less detailed someone was thinking about his/her 
reasons, the more happy they will be about a given list of 
answers. With a very low level of information/reflexion from 
the participant, it is likely that you will get an answer by 
chance.
• Disagreeable reasons, that would not be told in an open 
answer, can be included in a closed list of answers. 
Rules for asking questions
Lists of questions
• The lower the information of the participant, the more he will 
try to choose the „right“ given alternative. We know that he 
will choose a category in the lower middle (position effect).
• To avoid these position effect, the position of the questions 
should be changed (within the poll).
• The longer the descriptions, the more chance to confuse the 
participants. 
• Sometimes it is useful to avoid the „neither-nor“ category, so 
participants have to make up their mind and you can avoid 
the maybe, I don‘t know. 
Pretest
• Before you start your study: do a pretest
• With a limited number of cases, but cases 
should be within the final sample
• Get aware of unclear formulations and 
possible error sources 
• Be careful that you influence the 
information people have about the topic 
(so do not „re-ask“ the same sample)
Matrix of the User-Characteristics

User roles
• A collection of attributes that characterize 
certain user population and their intentional 
interaction with the system
• Task and responsibility based
• Individual preferences does not matte here

Role Modeling Steps
• brainstorm an initial set of user roles
– A user role is one user
– System roles are also useful
• organize the initial set of cards
– Tasks and responsabilities
• consolidate roles
• refine the roles
– The frequency with which the user will use the software.
– The user’s level of expertise with the domain.
– The user’s general level of proficiency with computers and software.
– The user’s level of proficiency with the software being developed.
– The user’s general goal for using the software. Some users are after 
convenience,
– others favor a rich experience, and so on.
53

Priorities and conflicts between user groups
54

Personas
• Technique based on data gathered through 
user research, mapping user archetypes 
(profiles), that represent a few important 
classes of users’ goals and needs 
55
Build a simple persona 
• Include: 
– Name
– A role or job title
– Quotes in the personas language
– Relevant demographics
– Descriptions that reveals goals, motivations, pain 
points 
– Descriptions that describe primary activities this 
user type will engage in.

Prototyping scenarios
59

Creating scenarios and user stories 
• White down representatives users tasks with the Web application
• Identify users tasks for each kind of user in all contexts of use
• Define:
– Context of use (street, work, home, etc …)
– How the system help to perform the task
– What is required to perform the task
– How important the task is for the user?
60
How to write a user story 
• Separation of the user/customer types’ goals (previous slides)
• Template: As a <some role>, I want <something>, so that <some 
value>
– Describes who wants, what wants and what for in one 
sentence
– Examples:
• “As an end user I want to be able to upload my picture to my 
profile page, so that my profile page looks cool”
• “As a sales person, I want to see statistics of my 
performance in graphical charts, so that I monitor my 
performance”
• “As an administrator, I want to have database backups, so 
that I won’t be in big trouble if something unexpected 
happens”
• User story does not define any details of the implementation!
• Every user story needs a Definition of Done (acceptance criteria)
