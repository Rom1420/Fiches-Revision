Task analysis: Definitions
• Task
• Goal
• Basic Task
• Task Analysis <> Activity analysis 
• Task Modeling
What is the point of task analysis? 
• Determine 
– What the users do
– The tools they use to do their work 
– The information they know or the information 
they must know for performing their work 
• Cover all/most cases
• Cover all/most users  
One small example
• To clean the house 
– Take the vacuum cleaner
– Plug it in 
– Use it in all the rooms 
– When the bag is full, empty it 
– Store the vacuum cleaner 
• You must know
– Where is the vacuum cleaner
– Where are the plugs 
– How to remove the bag
– Where are the new bags 
– Evaluate if a room is clean or not 
Information gathering
• Planned procedure
– Ask the boss 
– Look at the manual 
• Actual procedure 
– Ask the operator 
– Record operator behaviour
• Optimal procedure 
– The target for a good system
Task Analysis (Web application for museum)
• Tourist
– general and clear information in limited amount
– access by spatial representations
– guided navigation
• Art student
– some basic knowledge
– choice among different types of information  
• Expert
– precise requests
– detailed description of the information requested
Beware about the abstraction level 
• If you ask the following question:
What are you doing?
• You can get:
– I am striking ctrl-B keys
– I make "bonjour" in bold
– I make on word bold 
– I highlight a word
– I am modifying a document
– I am writing a letter 
– I keep contact with my familly 
– I am waiting for a phone call 
Building the task tree 
• 1 Build a list of tasks
• 2 Gather high-level tasks 
• 3 Breakdown low level tasks
• Where to stop ? 
– Is the action « empty bag » decomposed enough?
– Objective: only decompose pertinent tasks (objective 
optimization/automation of work)
– User actions: cognitive/motor usually not that interesting to decompose 
(except for performance evaluation)
– System activity MUST not be represented (will be in other models) 
• Highest level = reproduction of the specie
• Lowest level = biological life (breathe, drink a coffee , …) 
Example: make a cup of tea

Refining Models
• Once the model is built (whatever notation you use)
– How to be sure that it is correct?
– How to improve it?
• Some heuristics
– Coupled actions: e.g., where is "turn gas on"?
– Restructure : e.g. make a task generic “make pot”
– Balance : e.g. is “pour tea” simpler than “make pot”?
– Generalise: e.g. make one cup … make many
Example: make a cup of tea

Example: make a cup of tea

Examples of task analysis
• Tourist
– Book a train ticket
– Find a monument in the city
– Game of 15
• A client using a cash machine
– Withdraw money 
– Check the balance on the account 
– …
Party : The game of 15
• The game is played by 2
• You have the following tokens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
• People play in turn, each player take one token at a time, 
one token can only be taken once
• The first with 3 token of which the sum adds up to 15 is 
the winner
Play this game without tool (paper, pencil or other! )
Party : The game of 15
• Analyze one player task
–Propose a decomposition in sub tasks 
• Propose an interface (paper +pencil or 
computer tool) for this game
–The user interface must (of course) help the 
player to achieve his task
Beware !
• Not a cognitivist approach 
• Don’t include the system 
• Make sure models are correct 
• No algorithmic description (calculation of who is the 
winner)
• No task migration (the system performs tasks 
assigned to the player) 
• Who starts (difference between you play together 
and you play with ME - elbow communication)
Task Analysis 
Play the game of 15
Ensure turn taking Choose a token Evaluate if there 
is a winner
Remember token I 
have already taken
Remember the 
Remaining tokens

sometimes I receive an invoice from a sales man 
recently recruited. In such a case, I must create both

Engineering task models
• Flexible and expressive notations
• Systematic methods able to indicate how to 
use information in the task models
• Availability of automatic tools to use such 
information efficiently
The many possible task models
• Existing System 
– One or many systems
– One or many operators
• Envisioned System
– One or many systems
– One or many operators
• Variation of models (co-evolution)
Use of Task Models
• Better understanding of the application (and in 
particular its use)
• Record discussions (multidisciplinary)
• Help design
• Help usability evaluation
• Help performance evaluation
• Help user in performing the tasks (contextual help)
• Documentation (content + structure)
Representations of Task Models 
• Hierarchical task analysis
• GOMS family
• UAN
• K-made (web)
• AMBOSS (web)
• HAMSTERS
• Different syntax (textual vs graphical)
• Different level of formality
• Different set of operators for task composition

Limitations of GOMS
• It does not consider user errors
• It does not consider the possibility of 
interruptions
• It considers only sequential tasks
• It can be inadequate for distributed 
applications (such as web-based applications)
UAN - User Action Notation
• 2 complementary set of information
– A hierarchy of tasks LOTOS (proche de CTT)
– A table for describing states and feedback
• Textual notation 
• Introduced in 1992 (Hix & Hartson huge 
success Developing user interfaces Ensuring, 
Usability Through Product & Process) 
Example of UAN specification

ConcurTaskTrees
• Focus on Activities 
• Hierarchical Structure
• Graphical Syntax
• Rich set of temporal operators
• Task allocation
• Objects and task attributes
Task Models vs Scenarios
• Scenarios are informal descriptions of a 
specific use in a specific context
• Task models describe the possible activities 
and their relationships
• Scenarios can support task development
• Task models can support scenarios 
identification
Moving from scenarios to tasks
• Find verbs = tasks
• Find words = objects 
• Find adverbs = temporal relationships
Temporal Operators
• Enabling T1 >> T2 or T1 [ ]>> T2 
• Disabling  T1 [> T2 
• Interruption T1 |> T2
• Choice T1 [ ] T2 
• Iteration T1* or T1{n} 
• Concurrency T1 |||  T2      T1 |[]| T2
• Concurrency (must finish first) T1 |=| T2 
• Optionality [T]

Course objectives
• Know the benefits of using task description techniques to design 
interactive systems (tasks-based design)
• Be able to describe users’ activities in a systematic and structured way 
(examples and practical exercises) 
• Know how to use the HAMSTERS notation and tool for editing, analyzing 
and simulating task models (according to the current state of interaction 
what are the available tasks) help understand if it is a correct description
• Have experience in analyzing an interactive systems focusing on the tasks 
the users have to perform (manual and tool supported by HAMSTERS)
• Interact altogether on experiences on task-based design 
50
Descriptions of Tasks 
• Record information gathered during tasks analysis
• One important aspect of most development methods
• Useful for designing an interactive system that fits user work
– Identify complex activities in the current work
– Allocation of tasks to different actors
– Identify good candidate for automation 
51
Why Model-based approaches?
• Highlight important/relevant information
• Focus on abstract information (stay away from non 
relevant details)
• Help to manage complexity 
• One important aspect of most development 
methods
• Possibility to reason about models
• Support collaboration amongst stakeholders 
52
Affordance/Usability of models

Significant Models in HCI
• Task models
• Cognitive models e.g. SRK
• User models e.g. edutainment 
• Domain Models e.g. UML class diagrams
• Context Models e.g. location aware systems
• Presentation Models e.g. widgets libraries
• Dialogue models e.g. state machines 
• Platform models e.g. cellphones descriptions 
(display, CPU, …) 
54
Task models (versus task analysis)
• Manage information gathered from task analysis
– Structure
– Record
– Refine
– Analyze
– Reuse
• 3 Fundamental concepts in tasks modelling
– Hierarchical structure of tasks: Hierarchical Task Analysis (Annett & 
Duncan, 1967) (Annett, 2004)
– Knowledge representation: Task Knowledge Structure (Johnson et al. 
1989)
– Multi-user/Collaborative activities: Groupware Task Analysis (van der 
Veer 1996) 
55
What is the point of task analysis? 
• Determine 
– What the users do
– The tools they use to do their work 
– The information they know or the information they must know for 
performing their work 
– The knowledge they have (or must have)
– The objects they must or can use to perform their tasks 
– The strategies they apply (or must know) for performing the tasks
• Cover all/most cases
• Cover all/most users  
56
One small example
• To clean the house 
– Take the vacuum cleaner
– Plug it in 
– Use it in all the rooms 
– When the bag is full, empty it 
– Stop when finished
– Store the vacuum cleaner 
• You must know
– Where is the vacuum cleaner?
– Where are the plugs?
– How to remove the bag?
– Where are the empty bags?
– Should I start by the entrance or by the end of the room? – strategy (related to 
context)
– Should I have vacuum cleaner at maximum speed? – strategy
– Evaluate if a room is clean or not – situational knowledge

Information gathering
• Operators/users work 
– Planned procedure
• Ask the boss (regulations)
• Look at the manual or training material
– Actual procedure 
• Ask the operator 
• Record operator behavior
– Optimal/Minimal procedure 
• The target for an optimal system (maybe not the best one – e.g. aircraft 
cockpits)
• Tools around the workspace
– Post-it, memory joggers, annotations …
58
Beware about the abstraction level 
• If you ask the following question:
What are you doing?
• You can get:
– I am striking ctrl-B keys
– I make the world "bonjour" in bold
– I make one word bold 
– I highlight a word
– I am modifying a document
– I am writing a letter 
– I keep contact with my familly 
– I am waiting for a phone call 

Why the ATM ?
(Automated Teller Machine)
• Simple but meaningful example:
• System and activities already known by the audience
• Requires manipulation of several types of data
• Several versions of the system for withdrawing money:
• Manual way (at the bank office)
• ATM in public spaces
• Java version of the ATM (for the course)

Building the task tree 
• 1 - Build a list of tasks
• 2 - Gather high-level tasks 
• 3 - Breakdown low-level tasks
• Where to stop ? 
– Is the action “identify” decomposed enough?
– Objective: only decompose pertinent tasks (objective 
optimization/automation of work)
– User actions: perceptive/cognitive/motor usually not that interesting 
to decompose (except for performance evaluation or for interaction 
design)
– System activity MUST not be represented (will be in other models) but 
connections to it yes 
• Highest level = reproduction of the species ;-)
• Lowest level = biological life (breathe, drink, contract muscle …)

Refining Models
• Once the model is built (whatever notation you use)
– How to be sure that it is correct?
– How to improve it?
• Some heuristics
– Coupled actions: e.g., where is “Put card in card slot"?
– Restructure : e.g. make a task generic “Enter PIN digit”
– Balance : e.g. is “Select amount” simpler than “Identify”?
– Generalize: e.g. always withdraw a particular amount… 
withdraw different amounts 
111
Analysis of the completed models
• Qualitative
• Consistency of the users actions
• Detection of usability issues
• Quantitative
• Task complexity: How many actions have to be performed to reach the 
goal?
• Which are the different possible sequence of actions (scenarios) and what 
is the estimated min/max time for achieving them?
• What is the exhaustive list of required knowledge?
• Which information will have to be remembered and for how long?
112
Supported by HAMSTERS tool
• Distribution the total number of tasks across task 
types (Statistics panel)
• Estimated minimum and maximum time to perform 
a scenario (Statistics panel)
• Structural verification of the task model (Verification 
panel)
113

"Designing" task models
• Dealing with alternative options
• Functioning versus usage
• Interviews/scenarios for informing task model 
design
• Types of task models 
• Relationship with types of procedures
114
Dealing with alternative options
• Money withdrawal at the cashier
115

Structuring: Functioning versus Usage
• Extraterrestrial example (J. Grudin, A case 
against consistency, INTERACT 90)
• Example of a computer system
– We have a database with the following schema:
– Propose a menu tree allowing to manipulate that 
database

Example of Informal Task Description
• « I spent my day at work entering information for new clients 
and I must associate them with the more suitable sales man 
(according to various criteria) … sometimes I receive an 
invoice from a sales man recently recruited. In such a case, I 
must create both the new sales man and the client. 
Sometimes a sales man quits the company. Usually they leave 
the company for another one and the clients follow them. I 
then have to delete the sales man and all its related … »

• There is 
– Access to clients through their sales man
– Display of client information without getting to 
their sales man first
– Duplication of menu items in the hierarchy

Various types of task models
• Existing (extant) System 
– One or many systems
– One or many operators organization
• Envisioned System
– One or many systems
– One or many operators organization 
• Variation of models (co-evolution) as tasks are performed on a 
given system – task modeling is a moving target
