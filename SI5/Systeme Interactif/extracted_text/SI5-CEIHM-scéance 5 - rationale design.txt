Structure of the lecture
• About design process
• What is Design Rationale?  
• What is the purpose?
• How is it conducted?
• Contributions to HCI 
• Notations
First, about design
• Design is a problem-solving process whose 
objective is describe and find a way to… 
implement requirements, respecting 
constraints, and ensure good quality
• The result of the process includes:
– Specification of the product to be implemented
– A set of design decisions
4
Best solutions with respect 
to some criteria
Taking decisions

The design process 
• A designer has to face with several issues
– Each issue part of the overall problem
– Each issue might be solved by more than one 
design option
– The designer makes a decision to resolve every 
issue
• This process implies to chose the best option 
among the alternatives 
6
What is Design rationale?
• Rationale has to do with logical explanations 
and reasoning
• Discussions, debates, negotiations
• Reasons for features
• Reasons against features
• Weighing of tradeoffs 
7
Why to use Design Rationale?
• Increase understanding interaction situations by:
– Documentation
– Analysis
– Descriptions
– Causes and consequences
• Showing important aspects about:
– Context
– Applicability
– Scope
8
Steps in Design Rationale 
• Scenarios
• Narratives
• Generating claims
• Claims analysis
9
Scenarios
• Describe user interaction
• Created or observed situations
• Documented as narratives
• Several scenarios are recommended
• Typical scenarios comes from theory,  observation, 
field studies, personal experiences, documented 
experiences
• We look for situations where contradictions are 
obvious
10
Types of scenarios
• Goals: what can I do?
– What - other than sending e-mails - does this system 
support?
• Opportunism: what does this do?
– What does the “Rules” preference support?
• How-To: carrying out procedures.
– How do you add mailboxes and hierarchies of mailboxes?
• Sense-Making: what happened?
– Why is there suddenly a mailbox for drafts?
11
Claim analysis
• Claims are statements
– interpreted as design suggestions
– are carefully examined
• Every claim is associated with benefits and 
drawbacks, systematically documented
• Decisions are supported by theories relevant 
for the current situation
12
Supporting theories
• Psychological theories (see second class…)
– Memory
– Gestalt laws
– etc.
• Sociological theories
• Ergonomics
• Different point of views according to users
• ...
13
Tradeoff analysis
14

Example
• Have a shared calendar at work:
+ saves time when meetings are scheduled.
+ easy to know when people are available.
- but people have to remember to make a note of 
everything they do.
- but people might not feel comfortable that 
everyone knows where they are and what they 
do.
15
How to find claims
• Text analysis
– Scanning for causes & effects
• Pose questions related to situations/ 
actions/goals
– what made her click there?
• Analyze scenarios with users
• Reuse of prior analyses
• Use Norman’s stages of action
16
Norman’s stages of action
• Forming the goal
• Forming the intention
• Specifying an action
• Executing the action
• Perceiving the state of the world
• Interpreting the state of the world
• Evaluating the outcome

Summary
• Design rationale at several levels:
– A tool for communicating design 
alternatives/decisions to users or clients
– Contributes to general design knowledge
– Supports research approaches contributing to HCI 
theory
21
Exercise for the TD
• Examine and discuss scenarios and claims for 
the design options described with your 
prototypes 
– Are the scenarios plausible?
– Is it clear how the claims are identified?
– What HCI knowledge grounds the claims analysis?
– Can other claims be identified?
• See slide 15 for an example

Case Study
• Source: DGAC (French Civil Aviation Authority)
• Goals on this project:
a) To develop a formal description technique for describing 
widgets in user applications for cockpit display system; This 
issue has been addressed by extending the ICO notation;
b) To specify user applications compliant with ARINC 661 
standard, which is an aeronautical international standard.

ARINC 661 RadioBox 2 in context: 
Multi Purpose Interactive Application (MPIA) 

Rationalizing the Design of the ARINC 
RadioBox2 
• Known requirements are added to the diagram;
• Questions raised by designers during brainstorming meetings 
are included in the diagram;
• For each question raised, several design options should be 
explored and the relationships between them must be 
depicted by edges in the diagram;
• Any artifacts (i.e. ICO models in the case of the project) 
related to a particular element are connected to the 
corresponding design option;
• Criteria and factors influencing the choice are added to the 
diagram (e.g. ISO 9126 standard on Software Quality);
• Edges are added for connecting options and criteria;
