User tasks and infovis techniques

User tasks
2
Approach “what-why-how”
• It is a way to analyze visualization 
techniques using three questions:
• What
• Which data are represented
• Why
• Why users are using the visualization 
technique
• How
• Which are the visual codification and which 
are the interaction techniques implemented
Munzner, Tamara Visualization Analysis and Design. Boca Raton, FL:Taylor & Francis, 2014

Visual strategies for user tasks
• Two levels of abstraction to explain the relationship between user 
tasks and interaction with infovis techniques

Visual tasks
• Are characterized by two dimensions
• Visual goals )
• Goals that should be accomplished with the infovis technique
• Visual implications
• The visual actions the infovis technique implements

Munzner, 2014
Why people are using vis in terms of actions 
and targets
12
High-level actions: Analyze
• Consume
• Discover vs Present
• classical split
• explore vs explain
• Enjoy
• newcomer
• casual, social 
• Produce
• Annotate, Record
• Derive
• crucial design choice
13
Actions: Mid-level search, low-level query
• what does user know?
• target, location
• how much of the data 
matters?
• one, some, all
14
Why: Targets 
15
Interaction
• Distinguishes infovis from static paper visualizations.
• Analysis is a process, often iterative, with branches and sideways 
paths.
16
Acceptable Response Times
• .1 second
• Animation, visual continuity, sliders
• 1 second
• System response, pause in conversation
• 10 seconds
• Cognitive response
17
Basic Interaction Techniques
• Selecting
• Mouse click
• Mouseover / hover / tooltip
• Lasso / drag
• Rearrange 
• Move
• Sort
• Delete

How to ensure overview: by scalability
• Small datasets are easy 
• “Just show everything”
• Large datasets…
• What to exhibit?

22
Strategies for scalability
• Compress information
• Reduce size  (geometric zoom)
• Reduce amount of information 
• Compress without losing data (semantic zoom)
• Increase density
Data
screen
23
Example:  SeeSoft
• 1 pixel line per line of code
24
Reduce the amount of data
• Example
• Reduce # attributes
• Reduce # items
• Reduce range of values
• Two ways
• Remove
• Grouping
25
http://exposedata.com/parallel/
26
Remove= cut/ prunning
• Remove items
• Remove attributes
• Scatterplots:  
• Select 2 or 3 attributes, ignore the others
• Spotfire:  
• Use the query to select attributes
• And show details on demand 
• Problem: loosing information
27
Grouping= clustering
• Clustering (grouping many items in a one entity)
• What to group?
• By category  (SQL “group by”)
• Spatial (TableLens)
• By algorithm (clustering)
• Defined by the user (“folders”)
• What are the values associated to a group?
• Mathematic functions (SQL “group by”)
• Counting, average, min, max
• Semantic abstraction 
• Grouping many levels = trees
• Navigation:
• Parallel visualizations 
• Semantic zooming
28
Clustering
• Grouping attributes
•Simple example
• Function:  grade = (cc + project) / 2
•Statistic techniques
• PCA, …
•Similarity maps
• Mapping n-D to 1,2,3-D 
using distance between 
points

Advanced Interaction Techniques
• Overview + Detail (O+D)
• Focus + Context (F+C)
• Brushing and Linking
• Zoom: Panning and Zooming
• Transformation: distortion-based Views
30
Overview + Details
• Separate views
• No distortion
• Shows both overview and details simultaneously
• Drawback: requires the viewer to consciously shift there focus of attention.
31
Overview
 http://www.gapminder.org/
32
Overview
 • It provides
– Maps, spatial orientation
– Contextual information, 
relationships
– Which information is (or not) 
present in the display
• Detection of patterns
• Direct access
• Reduce searching process
• Enforce exploration, help to 
select the next move
• HCI metric – improve user 
performance, time of learning 
and satisfaction
33
Details and focus
34
Details and focus • It is the result of a 
cleaning data 
process (data that 
are of the 
scope/focus)
• It provides details 
about part of data
• Semantic zooming
35
Overview+Detail: Treemaps
• Treemaps: overview + detail (time separation)
36
Overview+Detail: Seesoft
• Spatial separation
37
Focus + Context
• A single view shows information in context
• Contextual info is near to focal poin
• Distortion may make some parts hard to interpret
• Distortion may obscure structure in data
• We’ll have a lecture on distortion later
• Examples from Xerox PARC: 
• TableLens
• Perspective Wall 
• Hyperbolic Tree Browser

43
Pan and Zoom
How to show a lot of information in a small space?
• Multiple Levels of Resolution
• The view changes depending on the “distance” from the viewer to the objects
• Distortion-based techniques
• Keep a steady overview, make some objects larger while simultaneously shrinking others
44
Zooming
• Standard Zooming
• Get close in to see information in more detail
• Example: Google earth zooming in
• Intelligent Zooming
• Show semantically relevant information out of proportion
• Smart speed up and slow down
• Example: speed-dependent zooming, Igarishi & Hinkley
• Semantic Zooming
• A semantic zoom control allows the user to zoom between two different semantic views 
of the same data set
• Zooming can be conceptual as opposed to simply reducing pixels
• Example tool: Pad++ and Piccolo projects
• http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/video/1998/1998_pad.mpg

Speed-dependent Zooming

tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/java/autozoom/autozoom.htm
46
Standard vs. Semantic Zooming
• Geometric (standard) zooming:
• The view depends on the physical properties of what is being viewed
• Semantic Zooming:
• When zooming away, instead of seeing a scaled-down version of an object, 
see a different representation
• The representation shown depends on the meaning to be imparted. 
47
Examples of Semantic Zoom
• Other examples 
• Zoom into restaurant: 
• see the interior
• see what is served there
• maybe zoom based on price instead!
• see expensive restaurants first
• keep zooming till you get to your price 
range

Examples of Semantic Zoom
• Infinitely scalable painting program
• close in, see flecks of paint
• farther away, see paint strokes
• farther still, see the holistic impression of the painting
• farther still, see the artist sitting at the easel
49
Pad++
• An infinite 2D plane
• Can get infinitely close to the surface too
• Navigate by panning and zooming
• Pan: 
• move around on the plane
• Zoom:
• move closer to and farther 
from the plane

• History: keep track of actions and insights
• Extract: mark and capture data
